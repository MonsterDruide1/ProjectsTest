## Future Ideas
- trigger full sync when new commit on OdysseyDecomp:master is detected
    - https://www.reddit.com/r/github/comments/1dikiqw/is_it_possible_to_trigger_actions_in_another_repo/
- add command to allow linking WIP branch that shows up in issue body, not only in comment below
    - as GitHub application, authenticate as user, then create new branch based on existing one, delete original, then "create linked branch" to the old name, finally delete temporary branch
- labels for "parts" of the game (at least separating al from rs)
